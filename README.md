# Art-Generation-with-neural-style-transfer-
Neural Style Transfer is an algorithm that given a content image C and a style image S can generate an artistic image. It uses representations (hidden layer activations) based on a pretrained ConvNet. The content cost function is computed using one hidden layer's activations.
